This is going to make the assumption you are using visual studio code if not you can download it here: https://code.visualstudio.com/
this will also make the assumption you downloaded the cypress file from github
you will also need node js which can be downloaded here https://nodejs.org/en/download/


1: open visual studio code 
2: navigate the the top bar and hit file and select open folder
3: open the cypress folder you downloaded from github
4: in the command line type "npx cypress open"
5: this should open a cypress window from there you can select the script you want to run
