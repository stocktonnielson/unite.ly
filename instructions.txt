This is going to make the assumption you are using visual studio code if not you can download it here: https://code.visualstudio.com/
this will also make the assumption you downloaded the cypress file from github
you will also need node js which can be downloaded here https://nodejs.org/en/download/


 open visual studio code 
 in the command line type in "npm install cypress" this will take a bit
 navigate the the top bar and hit file and select open folder
 open the cypress folder you downloaded from github
 in the command line type "npx cypress open"
 this should open a cypress window from there you can select the script you want to run
